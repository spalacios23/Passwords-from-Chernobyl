Truly Random Passwords from Radioisotopes

Welcome to PFC! We have a solution to boring PRNG password generation. With our Arduino-Based device, you can generate random passwords with just a few clicks. Simply build the device with the below parts list(3D Files included!) and get the Arduino code from here. Once you are finished building(and hopefully cable-managing those jumper wires!), install our web extention and connect your generator to your computer via USB. Follow the website manual below to generate your random passwords. 

P.S. - You can turn this thing into a geiger counter quite easily!!
